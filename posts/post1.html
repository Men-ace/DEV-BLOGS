            <h3>Introduction</h3>
                <p>
                    Full Stack Web Development involves building both the frontend and backend of an application. The frontend handles user interactions, while the backend manages business logic, databases, and API calls. A key challenge in modern web applications is managing state efficiently. This is where Redux, a predictable state management tool, becomes a valuable asset. However, not all applications require Redux; some can efficiently function without it. This article explores both approaches.
                </p>
            
        
        <h2>Full Stack Development Without Redux</h2>

        <ul>
          <li><b>UI Event:</b>In our UI which is our front end. User triggers soe events. Such as hovering, clicking on buttons, scrolling etc. But they are non-Functional if they don't have a place. if the logic is not written in the backend. For those backend functionality to be called, we need API.  </li>

          <li><b>API Call via axios:</b>Axios is a popular JavaScript library used for making HTTP requests in web applications. It is built on top of XMLHttpRequest and supports Promises, making asynchronous data fetching easier. <br>Uses .get(), .post(), .put(), .delete(), etc., for straightforward HTTP requests.</li>
          
          <li><b>Backend Processing:</b>The backend of a web application is the server-side part responsible for processing requests, handling business logic, managing databases, and ensuring security.</li>

          <li><h3>How API Interacts with the Database:</h3><b>Clients request:</b><p>The frontend sends an HTTP request (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) using Axios or Fetch.</p></li>

          <li><b>Express.js Route Handling:</b><p>The request is received by an Express.js route.</p></li>

          <li><b>Database Query Execution:</b><p>The backend queries a database (MongoDB, PostgreSQL, etc.) using an ORM like Mongoose or Sequelize.</p></li>

          <li><b>API Response:</b><p>The database processes the query and returns data to the API.</p></li>

          <li><b>State Update:</b><p>The UI updates based on the received data, either through Redux or component state.</p></li>
        </ul>
        
    
        <h2>Learning Resources</h2>
        <p>There are many great resources for learning web development:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Online platforms like freeCodeCamp, Codecademy, and MDN Web Docs</li>
          <li>YouTube tutorials</li>
          <li>Books like "HTML and CSS: Design and Build Websites" by Jon Duckett</li>
          <li>Local coding bootcamps or community college courses</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Building Your First Project</h2>
        <p>The best way to learn is by doing. Start with a simple project like a personal portfolio or a blog (like this one!). Don't worry about making it perfect—focus on applying what you've learned and solving problems as they arise.</p>
        
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>Web development is a journey, not a destination. The field is constantly evolving, so continuous learning is part of the process. Embrace the challenges, celebrate your victories, and don't be afraid to ask for help when you need it.</p>
        
        <p>Happy coding!</p>
